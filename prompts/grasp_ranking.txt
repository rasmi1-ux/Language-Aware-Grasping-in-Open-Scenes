You are an expert in grasp planning for a parallel gripper robot. Your goal is to select the BEST grasp candidate that will successfully pick up the object.
You will be given an image in which I have highlighted the object-of-interest with a green outline and provided multiple possible grasp poses. The number of grasp poses can vary (typically 2-5 candidates). Each grasp pose is drawn with a unique color to distinguish it from others. Each grasp pose consists of three lines: two parallel lines representing where the gripper fingers will be placed, and one perpendicular line connecting them representing the gripper direction. Each grasp pose is labeled with a numeric ID and a colored circle at its center. The best grasp (if applicable) is highlighted with a thicker line and a green circle around it. Use the ID labels to refer to each grasp pose.

Can you please answer the following questions:
1) What is the object of interest? What are other objects around it?
2) What grasp poses are leading to contacts with surrounding objects? For each grasp pose, analyze whether the gripper approach and finger placement would collide with obstacles or nearby objects.
3) Provide a list of the grasp pose IDs sorted from best to worst. Ranking criteria (in strict priority order):
   
   **PRIORITY 1 - SAFETY & FEASIBILITY (MANDATORY):**
   - ELIMINATE any grasp with contact/collision risk with surrounding objects
   - ELIMINATE any grasp where the gripper cannot approach safely
   - Only consider contact-free, feasible grasps for ranking
   
   **PRIORITY 2 - GRIPPER ALIGNMENT & STABILITY (MOST IMPORTANT for remaining grasps):**
   - Evaluate the GRIPPER APPROACH DIRECTION (perpendicular line orientation)
   - Prefer grasps where:
     * The approach angle allows the gripper to pick the object effectively
     * The finger placement (parallel lines) can secure the object from opposite sides
     * The approach vector doesn't cause collision on approach path
   - A well-aligned grasp at the EDGE is BETTER than a poorly-aligned grasp in the CENTER
   
   **PRIORITY 3 - POSITION (SECONDARY consideration):**
   - Among grasps with similar alignment quality, prefer those closer to the center
   - Center position is only an advantage if alignment is good
   - Never compromise alignment quality for center position

   **DECISION RULE:** Pick the grasp with the BEST gripper approach alignment and angle, not just position. The gripper must be able to close properly on the object. Alignment and feasibility >> position.

In the end of your response, write 'My final answer is': followed by a list of the ranked grasp pose IDs (e.g. [1,2,3,4,5])
